# BusinessIntelligence.ai 

## Round - 1 

A dashboard can show revenue dropped 8% in a region; it rarely explains why or what to do next — that translation still falls to an analyst, often taking days. Design a KPI storytelling engine: an AI system that explains in natural language what changed in a business metric, identifies likely root causes, and recommends next steps. It should use both structured and unstructured data.

Think about: How would the engine separate meaningful change from normal noise? How does it move from correlation to something a business leader can act on — and what does it do when the data is genuinely ambiguous?

## Round - 2

### Recap & Expanded Context

In Round 1, you explored a KPI storytelling engine that explains what changed in a business metric, identifies likely root causes, and recommends next steps in plain language. In practice, most businesses track KPIs across fragmented systems with different refresh cadences and granularities, and the "right" explanation for a movement often depends on who's asking and what they plan to do about it.

### Round 2 Objective

Design and demonstrate a working prototype of a KPI intelligence-to-action engine that:

Detects and prioritises material KPI movements.
Reconciles data and business context across heterogeneous sources.
Identifies and ranks explanatory drivers using appropriate analytical methods.
Generates persona-specific narratives supported by traceable evidence.
Communicates uncertainty and abstains when evidence is insufficient or contradictory.
Recommends practical actions grounded in business levers, constraints and decision rights.
Mechanism to learns from analyst and business-user feedback.
Operates within realistic security, cost, latency and scalability constraints.

The LLM should not be treated as the source of quantitative truth. Teams should explicitly demonstrate when they use deterministic logic, SQL, business rules, statistics, traditional ML, causal inference, retrieval or LLMs—and why.

### Real-World Complexities to Consider
Multiple interacting drivers such as price, volume, mix, marketing, supply, seasonality, competition and external events.
Different source-system refresh cadences, grains, data quality levels and historical coverage.
Inconsistent KPI definitions, hierarchies, calendars, business rules and aggregation logic.
Sparse history for new products, categories or markets.
Materiality based on both statistical significance and business impact.
Contradictory evidence, missing data and confidence calibration.
Role-based personalization of insight depth, recommended actions and delivery channels.
Row-, column- and domain-level security, sensitive-data protection and auditability.
Model and data drift, feedback capture and continuous evaluation.
LLM economics, including model choice, token consumption, latency, caching and cost per insight.

### Solutioning Areas You Could Explore

Teams may explore a hybrid combination of:
Anomaly detection, contribution analysis, forecasting, causal inference and business-rule reasoning.
Governed KPI semantics, metadata, lineage, business rules, ontology or knowledge graphs.
LLM-assisted intent understanding, orchestration, narrative synthesis and contextual retrieval.
Proactive alerts, conversational analysis, augmented dashboards or decision workspaces.
Confidence scoring, evidence citation, alternative hypotheses and abstention mechanisms.
Action recommendations structured as: driver → controllable lever → action → expected impact → owner → confidence → monitoring plan
Human feedback, expert validation, correction workflows and learning loops.
Platform-native and custom capabilities using Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, Tableau, Qlik, Looker or another suitable technology. (Open to chose any platform, or build completely custom solution or hybrid)
Platform-specific solutions are acceptable, but teams should distinguish between native, configured, custom-built and externally integrated capabilities.

### Minimum Prototype Expectations:

Three to five connected KPIs across two or three data sources with different grains or refresh cadences.
A lightweight KPI or semantic contract covering definitions, calculations, drivers, thresholds, lineage and access restrictions.
At least two personas receiving different insight narratives or recommended actions.
One multi-factor KPI movement with known or simulated underlying drivers.
One low-confidence scenario in which the engine requests clarification or abstains.
One sparse-history or newly launched KPI scenario.
One role-based security or entitlement scenario.
Evidence showing source freshness, analytical method, contribution, confidence and lineage.
A clear breakdown of LLM versus non-LLM processing.
Runtime telemetry covering latency, model calls, token usage and estimated cost.
